 <h2 id="info"> What is coding ? </h2>
 <p>
Coding is nothing but giving instructions to computer in programming language.
there are various programming languages like Cprogramming, C plus plus, java, .net e.t.c. coding can be done in two ways Block method and Text Method. 
In block method, we use ready-made codes and in text-method we type the codes. I have been teaching coding to wonderful little learners, since last one year. Block coding is the most basic form of computer programming and a great way for kids to get started. Rather than having to write complex lines of computer code, with block coding, kids can use visual instruction blocks to create games or moving animations – it uses a simple drag and drop interface.Block-based coding is very popular in schools as it offers an introduction to coding in a less intimidating way. Instead of traditional text-based programming, block-based coding involves dragging “bloc In a text-based programming language, coding is done by typing various characters following a certain syntax(rules and regulations) of a particular language. Some text-based languages include java, javascript, python, Lua.

 <h2> Where can we practice coding </h2>
  <p> There are various open source coding platforms available, where we can do block based or text based coding. For example, in code.org we can make interesting games, animations and mobile apps through block based or text based coding. </p>
